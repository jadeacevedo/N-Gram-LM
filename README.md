# N-Gram-LM
This project implements statistical N-gram language models from scratch to model and generate natural language text using probabilistic methods. It demonstrates a foundational approach to language modeling prior to neural architectures, emphasizing mathematical rigor, algorithmic clarity, and efficient implementation.
